This project uses idf esp_http_webserver which supports websockets.
This is an attempt to not use libraries outside the espressif or espressif-arduino framework.

a) try running ws_send frame async() (DN)  //will have to save the fd of a previous request to keep sending data - done
b) readup on applications using this library and websockets. (IP)

c) go through all examples to see how this library is used.(IP)

d) Try opening more instances of browser or postman to test opening multiple sockets - (DN)

e) test out function callbacks. Done, don't know why this is needed system does not do anything
//typedef esp_err_t (\*httpd_open_func_t)(httpd_handle_t hd, int sockfd); //prototype

    esp_err_t my_open_fn(httpd_handle_t hd, int sockfd)
{
    printf("Open Function:\n");

    printf("hd = %p\n", hd);

    printf("sockfd = %d \n\n", sockfd);

    return ESP_OK;
}

f) Try changing protocol to http from ws and see if it is handled
